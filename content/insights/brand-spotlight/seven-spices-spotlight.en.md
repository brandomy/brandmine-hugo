## A Chef's Vision

Maria Volkova's background in classical French cuisine might seem an unlikely foundation for a Russian spice company. Yet it's precisely this cross-cultural expertise that makes Seven Spices unique in the artisanal food market.

"Russian cuisine has incredible depth, but it's often misunderstood internationally," Volkova explains. "I wanted to create products that would help people discover authentic Russian flavors while being accessible to global palates."

## Cultural Bridge Through Flavor

Seven Spices' signature blends combine traditional Russian ingredients—wild herbs, berries, and mushrooms—with familiar international spices. The result is products that feel both exotic and approachable.

Their bestselling "Moscow Nights" blend combines black pepper, coriander, and dill with wild forest mushroom powder—a distinctly Russian touch that has resonated with Western European consumers seeking authentic new flavors.

## Quality Sourcing Network

The company maintains direct relationships with spice farmers across Asia and the Mediterranean, while Russian herbs are wild-harvested from sustainable sources in collaboration with local foragers.

"Every ingredient has a story and a relationship behind it," notes Volkova. "This isn't just good ethics—it's essential for maintaining the exceptional quality our customers expect."

## International Expansion

From its St. Petersburg base, Seven Spices has successfully expanded into Eastern European markets and is currently establishing distribution in Western Europe. The brand's success demonstrates growing international appetite for well-crafted specialty food products with authentic cultural roots.

Recent collaborations with chefs in Berlin and London have further elevated the brand's profile, introducing Russian culinary traditions to new audiences through the universal language of exceptional flavor.
