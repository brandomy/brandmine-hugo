## From Dormitory to Global Markets

In the bustling dormitories of Moscow State University in 2008, few would have noticed the small gatherings in Room 312, where economics student Alexei Sokolov hosted informal tea ceremonies for his friends. Using traditional Russian samovars and blends he created from local herbs and imported leaves, these sessions became legendary among students seeking respite from grueling study schedules.

"I never intended to start a business," Sokolov recalls. "I was studying economics because my parents insisted on a practical degree. The tea ceremonies were my creative escape."

Yet what began as a hobby would transform into one of Russia's most successful beverage exports, reaching markets across Europe, Asia, and now North America. TeaTime's journey from university project to international brand offers a masterclass in turning cultural heritage into global appeal.

## The Pivotal Moment

The turning point came during Sokolov's final semester in 2010. What had begun as informal gatherings had evolved into a small side business, with Sokolov selling custom blends to fellow students and faculty.

"My economics professor encouraged me to submit a business plan for TeaTime as my thesis project," Sokolov explains. "At first, I thought it was a joke. But he saw something I hadn't yet recognized—the potential to modernize Russian tea culture for global appreciation."

That business plan earned top marks and the attention of Mikhail Vronsky, a visiting alumnus and angel investor. Impressed by both the concept and the passionate presentation, Vronsky offered 5 million rubles (approximately $80,000 at the time) in seed funding.

## International Breakthrough

TeaTime's international breakthrough came in 2018 when luxury department store Harrods in London featured their Siberian Frost blend. The distinctive packaging and unique pine and berry notes caught the eye of even the most discerning tea connoisseurs.

"Entering the UK market—with its deep tea traditions—was intimidating," Sokolov admits. "But we learned that authenticity resonates universally. We didn't try to be British; we offered something distinctly Russian but with accessible flavor profiles."

This philosophy guided TeaTime's subsequent expansion into France, Germany, and Asian markets like Japan and Singapore.

## The Future: Tradition Meets Innovation

Today, TeaTime employs over 200 people, exports to 23 countries, and continues to grow at 30% annually. Sokolov remains deeply involved in product development despite pressure to step back.

"The company's soul comes from balancing respect for tea traditions with continuous innovation," he insists.

When asked what advice he would give to other founders, Sokolov's answer reflects the philosophical approach that has defined TeaTime's success: "Don't just build a product; build a bridge between worlds. For us, that's a bridge between Russian tea traditions and global consumers seeking authentic experiences. Find your bridge, and build it with absolute integrity."
