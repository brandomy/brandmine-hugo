Walk of Shame transformed underground post-Soviet style into a globally recognized luxury streetwear brand. Founded by Yana Puaca in 2017, the company proved that Eastern European fashion could compete at the highest levels by reclaiming the narrative of post-Soviet culture and showing the world that this aesthetic can be luxury, not just survival.

## Post-Soviet Aesthetic as Luxury

Walk of Shame draws inspiration from post-Soviet visual culture—brutalist architecture, vintage typography, and the raw aesthetic of 1990s Eastern Europe—and transforms it into premium streetwear with an average price point of $300+. This bold recontextualization challenges Western perceptions and celebrates Eastern European cultural identity.

## Celebrity Endorsements & Global Reach

With 50+ celebrity endorsements and 500K+ Instagram followers, Walk of Shame has achieved cult status in luxury streetwear. The brand's presence in 200+ global stockists demonstrates that Russian design can command premium positioning in international markets.

## Cultural Reclamation

Beyond fashion, Walk of Shame represents a movement to reclaim post-Soviet aesthetics from negative stereotypes. By positioning these cultural elements as luxury design language, Yana Puaca has created space for Eastern European creators to celebrate their heritage on the global stage.

## Premium Market Positioning

Walk of Shame's success at premium price points ($300+ average) validates that Russian fashion brands can compete beyond fast fashion. The brand's export-ready status and international stockist network prove that quality, design, and cultural authenticity can drive global demand.
