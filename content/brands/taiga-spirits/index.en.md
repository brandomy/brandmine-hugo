Taiga Spirits produces ultra-premium vodka and botanical spirits using pristine water from Lake Baikal and wild Siberian botanicals. Founded by former oil executive Dmitri Morozov, the company has quickly established itself as a luxury spirits brand competing successfully in international markets.

## Siberian Purity

The company's flagship vodka is distilled using water from Lake Baikal, the world's oldest and deepest freshwater lake. Combined with organic Siberian wheat and traditional distillation methods, the result is a vodka of exceptional smoothness and purity.

## Botanical Innovation

Taiga Spirits' signature line of botanical spirits features wild Siberian ingredients: pine needles, cloudberries, and cedar nuts. These innovative products have won multiple international spirits competitions and gained distribution in premium bars worldwide.

## Luxury Positioning

The brand's premium positioning and distinctive Siberian heritage have resonated strongly in Western European and North American markets. Taiga Spirits demonstrates that Russian spirits brands can compete at the highest luxury tiers when quality and storytelling are paramount.

## Rapid Growth

From zero to $10M+ in revenue within five years, Taiga Spirits represents one of Russia's most successful recent spirits launches. The company now exports to 25+ countries with particularly strong presence in UK, Germany, and Singapore.
