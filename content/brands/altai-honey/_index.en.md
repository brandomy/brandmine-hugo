---

Altai Gold Honey sources the world's finest wild honey from the pristine Altai Mountains, where diverse alpine flora creates uniquely complex flavor profiles. Founded by beekeeper Ivan Petrov, the company combines traditional sustainable harvesting methods with modern quality standards to produce exceptional organic honey products.

## The Altai Advantage

The Altai Mountains' untouched wilderness provides ideal conditions for wild honey production. Over 2,000 species of flowering plants, many found nowhere else on Earth, contribute to honey with remarkable depth and medicinal properties. Altai Gold's beekeepers work with wild bee colonies using methods passed down through generations.

## Sustainability Pioneer

The company has pioneered sustainable wild honey harvesting techniques that protect both bee populations and mountain ecosystems. Their certification as Russia's first carbon-neutral honey producer demonstrates their commitment to environmental stewardship.

## International Recognition

Altai Gold Honey has won multiple international awards and exports to markets across Europe and Asia. The brand's success proves that Russian artisanal food products can compete at the highest global levels when quality and authenticity are paramount.
