# Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu: Building Africa's First Global Footwear Brand

Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu is the founder and CEO of SoleRebels, Africa's first global footwear brand. A social entrepreneur from Addis Ababa, Bethlehem has spent nearly two decades proving that African brands can create world-class products that compete anywhere while maintaining cultural authenticity and social responsibility.

## Vision Born from Community

Growing up in the Zenabwork community on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Bethlehem witnessed the economic challenges facing her neighbors. In 2005, she founded SoleRebels with a clear mission: create high-quality, sustainable footwear that would generate meaningful employment for her community while showcasing Ethiopian craftsmanship to the world.

## Heritage Meets Innovation

Bethlehem's approach combines centuries-old Ethiopian shoemaking traditions with modern sustainable practices. Each SoleRebels shoe uses hand-spun organic cotton, recycled tire soles, and traditional weaving techniquesâ€”materials and methods that honor Ethiopian heritage while meeting global quality standards.

## Global Impact

Under Bethlehem's leadership, SoleRebels has expanded to 50+ stores across 30+ countries, creating over 500 local jobs and achieving Fair Trade certification. Her success demonstrates that profitability and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive, and that African brands can command premium positioning in global markets.

## Inspiring a Generation

Bethlehem's achievements have made her a role model for African entrepreneurs, particularly women founders. Her message is clear: "We wanted to show the world that Africa could create world-class products that compete anywhere. Our shoes tell the story of Ethiopian heritage while meeting global quality standards."
