# Yana Puaca: Reclaiming Post-Soviet Aesthetics

Yana Puaca is the founder and creative director of Walk of Shame, the luxury streetwear brand that transformed underground post-Soviet style into a globally recognized fashion movement. A Moscow-based designer with a bold vision, Yana has spent seven years proving that Eastern European aesthetics can command premium positioning in international markets.

## Cultural Reclamation as Design Philosophy

Growing up in post-Soviet Russia, Yana witnessed how Western media portrayed Eastern European culture through stereotypes and negativity. Rather than reject this heritage, she embraced it—transforming brutalist architecture, vintage typography, and 1990s visual culture into a sophisticated design language that celebrates rather than apologizes.

## Building Cult Status

Walk of Shame's rise from underground brand to 500K+ Instagram followers and 50+ celebrity endorsements demonstrates Yana's understanding of modern luxury. By creating scarcity, maintaining creative integrity, and refusing to compromise her aesthetic vision, she built genuine cult status rather than chasing mainstream acceptance.

## Premium Market Success

With an average price point of $300+ and presence in 200+ global stockists, Walk of Shame proves that Russian fashion can compete at the highest levels. Yana's success validates that cultural authenticity and premium positioning are not mutually exclusive—in fact, they can be mutually reinforcing.

## Vision for Eastern European Fashion

Yana's message is clear: "We're not just making clothes - we're reclaiming the narrative of post-Soviet culture and showing the world our aesthetic can be luxury, not just survival." Through Walk of Shame, she has created space for a new generation of Eastern European designers to celebrate their heritage on the global stage.
