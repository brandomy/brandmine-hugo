# Vineeta Singh: Redefining Beauty in India

Vineeta Singh is the co-founder and CEO of Sugar Cosmetics, India's fastest-growing cosmetics brand. An IIM Ahmedabad graduate who turned down lucrative consulting offers to pursue entrepreneurship, Vineeta has built a $1.2B+ unicorn by speaking directly to young Indian women about confidence, self-expression, and challenging conventional beauty standards.

## Entrepreneurial Journey

Before Sugar Cosmetics, Vineeta co-founded Fabbag, a beauty subscription service that taught her crucial lessons about the Indian beauty market. She recognized that young Indian women wanted cosmetics that spoke to their lifestyle and valuesâ€”not watered-down versions of international brands or traditional Indian alternatives.

## Digital-First Philosophy

Vineeta built Sugar Cosmetics entirely through digital channels, creating authentic content on Instagram, YouTube, and e-commerce platforms that resonated with millennial and Gen Z consumers. This approach allowed Sugar to bypass traditional advertising budgets while building genuine emotional connections with customers.

## Bold Brand Positioning

The "Not Just Pretty" campaign exemplifies Vineeta's approach: challenging beauty norms and positioning makeup as tools for confidence and self-expression. This bold stance differentiated Sugar in a crowded market and attracted young consumers seeking brands that understood their values.

## Omnichannel Success

Despite its digital origins, Sugar Cosmetics now operates in 40,000+ retail outlets while maintaining 60% digital sales. This omnichannel strategy has driven 300% revenue growth and proven Vineeta's vision: "We didn't just want to sell cosmetics - we wanted to change how young Indian women thought about beauty and self-expression. Our products are tools for confidence."
