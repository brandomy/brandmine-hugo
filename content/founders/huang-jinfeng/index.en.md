# Huang Jinfeng (David): The Beauty Disruptor

Huang Jinfeng, known as David in international markets, is the founder and CEO of Perfect Diary, China's first publicly traded beauty company. A former investor turned entrepreneur, David revolutionized Chinese beauty marketing by pioneering comprehensive KOL strategies that connected authentically with Gen Z consumers.

## From Investment to Innovation

Before founding Perfect Diary in 2017, David worked in private equity, analyzing consumer brands and identifying market gaps. He recognized that young Chinese consumers wanted domestic beauty brands that matched international quality while understanding local preferences and cultural values.

## KOL Marketing Pioneer

David's most significant innovation was building a systematic approach to KOL marketing at scale. Perfect Diary worked with over 15,000 influencers and micro-influencers across Weibo, WeChat, Xiaohongshu, and Douyin, creating authentic peer recommendations that resonated far more than traditional advertising.

## Product-First Philosophy

Despite his marketing brilliance, David's core belief is simple: "Product is king. Great products make great companies. Great companies make great industries." This focus on product quality enabled Perfect Diary to rank #2 among Gen Z's favorite domestic brands in 2019, second only to Huawei.

## Current Vision

While Perfect Diary has faced post-pandemic headwinds common to digital-native brands, David remains committed to building China's beauty industry. His success has inspired a generation of C-beauty entrepreneurs and proven that Chinese brands can compete globally on innovation, not just price.
