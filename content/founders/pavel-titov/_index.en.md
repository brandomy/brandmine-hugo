Pavel Titov brings 15 years of luxury hospitality expertise to Russia's specialty tea renaissance. After managing prestigious five-star hotels in Moscow, Pavel recognized a gap in the market for authentic, premium tea experiences that honored Russian traditions while meeting international quality standards.

## Professional Journey

Pavel's career began at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), where he developed a deep understanding of international business and cultural exchange. His subsequent roles at leading Moscow hotels gave him firsthand insight into evolving consumer preferences and the growing appetite for premium, culturally-grounded experiences.

## Building TeaTime

In 2018, Pavel founded TeaTime with a clear vision: to create a modern Russian tea brand that could compete internationally while staying true to centuries of Russian tea culture. His hospitality background proved invaluable in creating inviting retail spaces that function as cultural destinations as much as commercial enterprises.

## International Vision

Fluent in Russian, English, and German, Pavel is actively building partnerships across Central Asia and exploring opportunities in China and Southeast Asia. His approach combines respect for local traditions with rigorous quality standards and modern business practices.

## Leadership Philosophy

Pavel believes in building sustainable, family-oriented businesses that prioritize employee development and community engagement. Under his leadership, TeaTime has grown to 45 employees while maintaining a culture of excellence and continuous innovation.
