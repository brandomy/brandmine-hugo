# CEO-COO-CTO Workflow: Collaborative Excellence

**Context**: How we work efficiently at Brandmine with strategic oversight and autonomous execution.

**Key Principle**: CEO defines outcomes, COO ensures quality and feasibility, CTO owns execution completely.

---

## Role Definitions

### CEO (Business Strategy)
- Define **what** needs to be achieved and **why**
- Provide business context and success criteria
- Validate results against business objectives
- **Not responsible for**: Todo lists, implementation plans, technical decisions

### COO (Strategic Advisor & Quality Assurance)
- Advise on **feasibility** and strategic alignment
- Review **quality** of technical deliverables
- Translate business needs into technical context
- Assess risks and recommend approaches
- **Not responsible for**: Code implementation, detailed debugging, blocking CTO-CEO communication

### CTO (Technical Execution)
- Determine **how** to achieve business objectives
- Create own implementation plans and todo lists
- Make all technical decisions autonomously
- Execute completely without requiring step-by-step approval
- Report results when complete

## System Access Constraints

### Database (Supabase)
- **CEO has access**: Supabase dashboard and SQL Editor
- **CTO does NOT have access**: Cannot directly execute SQL
- **Workflow**: CTO writes SQL → CEO executes in Supabase → CTO verifies in application

### Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)
- **CTO has access**: Git push triggers automatic deployment
- **CEO monitors**: Verifies deployments are successful

### Source Control (GitHub)
- **Both have access**: CTO commits code, CEO can review

---

## Communication Pattern

### CEO Instruction Format
```
"I need [business outcome] for [users/customers] because [business reason]"

Examples:
- "Add contact form to About page so customers can reach us"
- "Create brand profiles for 4 new brands from this spreadsheet"
- "Fix mobile navigation - customers can't find the search feature"
```

**What CEO does NOT say:**
- ❌ Step-by-step instructions
- ❌ Technical implementation details
- ❌ Database schema designs
- ❌ "First do X, then do Y, then do Z"

### Collaborative Response Pattern
```
1. CEO: Define business outcome and reason
2. COO: Assess feasibility and provide strategic guidance
3. CTO: Propose technical approach
4. CEO: Approve approach
5. CTO: Execute completely (autonomous)
6. COO: Review quality
7. CEO: Validate business result
```

**Example:**
```
CEO: "Add contact form to About page so customers can reach us"

COO: "Contact forms are straightforward. Recommend Supabase backend for
      consistency with existing stack. Consider spam prevention and
      source tracking for leads. Low risk, high business value."

CTO: "I'll implement contact form with Supabase backend, spam prevention,
      and source tracking. Estimate 2-4 hours. Proceed?"

CEO: "Approved - build it"

[CTO creates own implementation plan:]
- Write Supabase migration SQL (contacts table)
- Provide SQL to CEO for Supabase execution
- Build form component with validation
- Add spam prevention trigger (SQL provided to CEO)
- Implement source tracking
- Test submission flow after CEO deploys SQL
- Deploy frontend to production

[CTO completes work]

CTO: "Contact form complete. Ready for review."

COO: [Reviews implementation quality, security, mobile-responsiveness]
     "Quality confirmed. Meets technical and business standards."

CEO: [Tests functionality]
     "Perfect - customers can now reach us easily."
```

---

## Backlog System

**Purpose**: Capture future ideas without CEO needing to track them.

**File**: `docs/BACKLOG.md`

### Usage Pattern

**CEO adds items:**
```
"Code, backlog this: Add interactive map to brand profiles"
OR
"CTO, backlog this: Add interactive map to brand profiles"
```

**CTO response:**
1. Creates backlog entry with:
   - Unique ID (#007)
   - Scope breakdown
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Status: Backlogged
2. Confirms: "Added to backlog as #007"

**CEO does NOT:**
- ❌ Maintain todo lists
- ❌ Track backlog status
- ❌ Manage priorities beyond "high/future/ideas"

**CTO owns:**
- ✅ All backlog maintenance
- ✅ Status tracking
- ✅ Implementation planning when item is prioritized

---

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. CEO Provides Instruction
```
"Implement feature X to achieve business outcome Y for [users]"
```

### 2. COO Strategic Assessment
```
"Feasibility: [assessment]
 Risks: [potential issues]
 Recommendation: [approach guidance]
 Business Value: [impact analysis]"
```

### 3. CTO Proposes Approach
```
"I'll build [solution] using [technical approach].
 Estimate: [timeframe]. Confirm this meets your needs?"
```

### 4. CEO Approves
```
"Approved - build it"
OR
"Adjust: [specific business concern]"
```

### 5. CTO Autonomous Execution

**CTO creates own plan:**
- Break down into technical tasks
- Create implementation todo list
- Make architecture decisions
- Execute all steps independently

**CTO does NOT:**
- Ask permission for each step
- Request approval for technical choices
- Report progress on individual tasks
- Wait for CEO or COO micromanagement

### 6. COO Quality Review
```
"Quality confirmed: [technical standards met]
 Security: [assessment]
 Performance: [evaluation]
 Business alignment: [verification]"
OR
"Issues found: [specific quality concerns requiring fix]"
```

### 7. CEO Validates Business Result
```
"Perfect - achieves the business objective"
OR
"Needs adjustment: [specific business requirement not met]"
```

## Decision-Making Authority

### CTO Full Authority (No Permission Needed)
- ✅ Database schema design
- ✅ Framework and library choices
- ✅ Code architecture patterns
- ✅ UI/UX implementation details
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Security implementations
- ✅ Deployment strategies
- ✅ Testing approaches

### COO Advisory Role (Not Approval)
- ✅ Provide feasibility assessments
- ✅ Review quality after completion
- ✅ Recommend best practices
- ✅ Identify risks and trade-offs
- ❌ Does NOT block or approve CTO decisions
- ❌ Does NOT restrict CEO-CTO communication

### CEO Approval Required
- Business feature priorities
- Strategic technical approaches (before CTO executes)
- Customer-facing copy/messaging
- Brand identity elements
- Strategic pivots
- Major cost implications

## Example Sessions

### Example 1: Simple Feature Request

**CEO**: "Add LinkedIn icons to About page team member profiles"

**CTO Process** (internal, not reported):
1. Review About page template
2. Find official LinkedIn brand icons
3. Add to Randal and Olya profiles
4. Implement hover states
5. Test on EN/RU/ZH versions
6. Commit changes

**CTO Report**: "LinkedIn icons added to About page profiles with hover effects. Works across all languages."

**CEO**: "Perfect"

---

### Example 2: Complex Feature (3-Role Workflow)

**CEO**: "Build contact form system so customers can reach us from multiple pages"

**COO**: "Contact forms are standard functionality. Recommend:
- Supabase for backend consistency
- Spam prevention essential
- Source tracking for lead attribution
- Mobile-first design for accessibility
Risk: Low. Business value: High. Estimate: 3-5 hours."

**CTO**: "I'll build Supabase-backed contact form with spam prevention, source
tracking, and mobile optimization. Proceed?"

**CEO**: "Approved - build it"

**CTO Process** (internal, autonomous):
1. Design Supabase schema (contacts table, RLS policies)
2. Create SQL migrations with spam prevention
3. Build form component with validation
4. Add source tracking (About vs Build with Us)
5. Implement mobile-responsive styling
6. Test submission flow end-to-end
7. Deploy to production
8. Document in docs/database/

**CTO**: "Contact form system complete. Ready for review."

**COO**: "Quality review complete:
- Security: RLS policies correct, spam prevention working
- Performance: Fast load, efficient queries
- Mobile: Responsive on all devices
- Standards: Meets all technical requirements
Status: Approved"

**CEO**: [Tests form on About page]
"Perfect - customers can reach us easily. Excellent work."

---

### Example 3: Backlog Addition

**CEO**: "Code, backlog this: Add interactive map showing brand headquarters on profile pages"

**CTO**:
"Added to backlog as #007: MapLibre Mini Map on Brand Profiles
 - Scope: 300x200px map using headquarters coordinates
 - Tech: MapLibre GL JS (no API keys needed)
 - Status: Backlogged for future implementation"

**CEO**: "Good"

[Weeks later]

**CEO**: "Let's do the brand maps now"

**CTO**: [Reviews backlog #007, creates implementation plan, executes completely, reports results]

---

## Communication Efficiency

### High-Efficiency Pattern ✅
```
CEO: "Implement X for outcome Y"
COO: "Feasible. Recommend approach Z. Low risk, high value."
CTO: "I'll build using approach Z. Proceed?"
CEO: "Approved"
CTO: [Executes completely, autonomously]
CTO: "Complete. Ready for review."
COO: "Quality confirmed. Meets standards."
CEO: "Perfect - achieves outcome Y"
```

### Low-Efficiency Anti-Pattern ❌
```
CEO: "Implement X. First do A, then B, then C..."
CTO: "Completed A. Should I do B?"
CEO: "Yes, also add D"
CTO: "Done B and D. What about C?"
CEO: "Do C but change it to E"
[COO not consulted, technical quality unknown, CTO waiting for each step]
```

## Implementation Checklist for Other Projects

To replicate this workflow:

**Setup (One-time):**
1. Create `CLAUDE.md` with role definitions (CEO/COO/CTO authority boundaries)
2. Create `docs/dev-charter.md` defining workflow protocol
3. Create `docs/BACKLOG.md` for task tracking
4. Define backlog format (ID, scope, acceptance criteria, status)
5. Establish "Code, backlog this:" command pattern

**Workflow (Ongoing):**
1. CEO provides business objectives, not implementation steps
2. COO advises on feasibility, risks, and approach recommendations
3. CTO proposes technical approach and gets CEO approval
4. CTO executes autonomously with own plans and todo lists
5. COO reviews quality and technical standards
6. CEO validates business outcomes

**Communication Standards:**
- **CEO**: Focus on **what** and **why** (business outcomes)
- **COO**: Provide **feasibility**, **risks**, and **quality review** (strategic advisor)
- **CTO**: Own **how** and **when** (autonomous technical execution)
- **Backlog**: System tracks tasks, not CEO's memory

---

## Key Principle

**CEO is not a project manager. COO is not a blocker. CTO is not micromanaged.**

- CEO defines outcomes and validates results
- COO advises and ensures quality
- CTO owns complete autonomous execution

This creates velocity, quality, and allows CEO to focus on business strategy and customer discovery while COO ensures technical excellence without implementation burden.
