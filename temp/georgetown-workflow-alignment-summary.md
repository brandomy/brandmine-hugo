# Georgetown Workflow Alignment Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Purpose**: Document changes made to align Georgetown project with Brandmine's 3-role collaborative workflow

---

## Key Changes Overview

### 1. Role Structure Clarification

**Changed From:**
- CEO-CTO 2-role workflow
- "Technical COO" as hierarchical blocker
- Restrictive CTO communication rules

**Changed To:**
- CEO-COO-CTO 3-role collaborative workflow
- COO as strategic advisor and quality reviewer (not blocker)
- Free CTO-CEO communication for business clarification

---

## Documents Updated

### A. [docs/workflows/ceo-coo-cto-workflow.md](../docs/workflows/ceo-coo-cto-workflow.md)
*Previously: `docs/reference-data/ceo-cto-workflow.md`*

**Changes:**
1. **Title**: "CEO-CTO Workflow" → "CEO-COO-CTO Workflow: Collaborative Excellence"
2. **Added COO Role Definition**:
   - Strategic advisor (not blocker)
   - Quality assurance reviewer
   - Feasibility and risk assessor
   - Does NOT block CTO-CEO communication

3. **Added "System Access Constraints" Section**:
   - **Supabase**: CEO has access, CTO does NOT
   - **Workflow**: CTO writes SQL → CEO executes → CTO verifies
   - **Cloudflare**: CTO deploys via git push
   - **GitHub**: Both have access

4. **Updated Workflow Pattern** (7 steps):
   ```
   1. CEO: Define business outcome
   2. COO: Assess feasibility and provide guidance
   3. CTO: Propose technical approach
   4. CEO: Approve approach
   5. CTO: Execute autonomously
   6. COO: Review quality
   7. CEO: Validate business result
   ```

5. **Updated All Examples**:
   - Show COO providing strategic assessment
   - Show CTO proposing approach before execution
   - Show COO reviewing quality after completion
   - Example: Contact form shows CTO providing SQL to CEO for Supabase execution

6. **Updated Communication Efficiency Section**:
   - High-efficiency pattern includes all 3 roles
   - Anti-pattern shows consequences of skipping COO review

7. **Updated Decision-Making Authority**:
   - Added "COO Advisory Role (Not Approval)" section
   - Clarified COO does not block or approve CTO decisions
   - Clarified COO does not restrict CEO-CTO communication

8. **Updated Backlog Command**:
   - Supports both: "Code, backlog this:" AND "CTO, backlog this:"

---

### B. [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)

**Changes:**
1. **Added "Database Access Constraint (CRITICAL)" Section**:
   ```markdown
   - CTO CANNOT access Supabase dashboard or SQL Editor
   - Only CEO can execute SQL in Supabase
   - Workflow: CTO writes SQL → Provides to CEO → CEO executes → CTO verifies
   ```

2. **Replaced "CTO Communication Restrictions"** with **"CTO Communication Freedom"**:
   - FROM: "PROHIBITED: Strategic discussions with CEO"
   - FROM: "REQUIRED: Report completions to Technical COO first"
   - TO: "Ask CEO business clarification questions anytime"
   - TO: "Propose technical approaches directly"
   - TO: "Report results to COO for quality review (not permission)"

3. **Updated Task Management**:
   - FROM: TODO.md workflow with GitHub Actions sync
   - TO: BACKLOG.md system with CTO ownership
   - Supports: "Code, backlog this:" OR "CTO, backlog this:"

4. **Updated Backlog Ownership**:
   - CTO owns: All backlog maintenance, status updates, planning
   - CEO does NOT: Track tasks or manage priorities
   - COO reviews: Quality of completed items (not task management)

---

### C. [docs/workflows/database-migration-workflow.md](../docs/workflows/database-migration-workflow.md)

**Changes:**
1. **Updated Participants Line**:
   - FROM: "CTO (execution)"
   - TO: "CTO (SQL development), CEO (Supabase execution), COO (quality review)"

2. **Added Key Constraint** (top of document):
   ```markdown
   Key Constraint: Only CEO has Supabase dashboard access.
   CTO writes SQL, CEO executes it.
   ```

3. **Updated Process Overview** (5 steps):
   - FROM: Step 3 "Local Testing" (implied CTO could test in Supabase)
   - TO: Step 3 "CEO Execution" (CEO runs SQL in Supabase)
   - FROM: Step 4 "Production Deployment" (implied already done)
   - TO: Step 4 "CTO Verification" (CTO tests after CEO deploys)

4. **Rewrote Step 3: CEO Execution in Supabase**:
   - CTO provides deployment instructions to CEO
   - CEO executes SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
   - CEO confirms deployment to CTO
   - Optional: CEO runs verification queries

5. **Rewrote Step 4: CTO Verification**:
   - After CEO confirms deployment
   - CTO tests functionality with `npm run dev`
   - CTO updates migration file header with deploy date
   - CTO documents changes

6. **Updated Quality Checklist**:
   - Clear CTO/CEO role separation:
     - ✅ **CTO**: Writes SQL, creates migration file, verifies in app
     - ✅ **CEO**: Executes SQL in Supabase, confirms deployment
     - ✅ **CTO**: Updates docs and commits to git

### D. [docs/dev-charter.md](../docs/dev-charter.md)

**Changes:**
1. **Team Structure**:
   - FROM: "Technical COO"
   - TO: "COO: Business & Technical Advisor"

2. **COO Role Definition**:
   - Added: "Does NOT block CTO-CEO communication"
   - Emphasis: Strategic advisor, not hierarchical blocker

3. **Communication Protocols**:
   - CEO ↔ CTO: "No restrictions - CTO can ask CEO business questions anytime"
   - Removed: All restrictive communication rules

4. **Workflow Protocol**:
   - Added 7-step collaborative process (same as ceo-coo-cto-workflow.md)
   - Added communication pattern example

5. **Backlog System**:
   - Supports: "Code, backlog this:" OR "CTO, backlog this:"
   - CTO owns all backlog maintenance
   - Purpose: "System tracks tasks, not CEO's memory"

---

### E. [docs/BACKLOG.md](../docs/BACKLOG.md)

**Created New File:**
- CTO ownership clearly defined
- Usage: "Code, backlog this:" OR "CTO, backlog this:"
- Status tracking: backlog → in progress → completed
- Pre-populated with Georgetown items (#001-004)
- Template for new items included

---

### F. Migration & Archive

**Archived:**
- `TODO.md` → `docs/archive/TODO-old-workflow.md`
- Created: `docs/archive/TODO-migration-note.md` documenting the change

---

## Key Principles Established

### 1. Three-Role Collaboration
```
CEO: Defines WHAT and WHY (business outcomes)
COO: Advises on feasibility, risks, quality (strategic advisor)
CTO: Determines HOW and WHEN (autonomous execution)
```

### 2. COO is Advisor, Not Blocker
- ✅ Provides strategic guidance
- ✅ Reviews quality after completion
- ✅ Recommends best practices
- ❌ Does NOT approve or block CTO decisions
- ❌ Does NOT restrict CEO-CTO communication

### 3. CTO Autonomy with Strategic Support
- CTO proposes technical approach → CEO approves → CTO executes autonomously
- CTO can ask CEO business questions anytime
- COO reviews quality (not for permission, but for professional standards)

### 4. Database Access Separation
- **CTO**: Writes SQL, cannot execute in Supabase
- **CEO**: Executes SQL in Supabase dashboard
- **Workflow**: CTO writes → CEO runs → CTO verifies

### 5. Task Management
- System (BACKLOG.md) tracks tasks, not CEO's memory
- CTO owns all backlog maintenance
- CEO adds items: "Code/CTO, backlog this: [description]"

---

## Workflow Comparison

### Before (Georgetown Old)
```
CEO → Technical COO → CTO (hierarchical)
CTO PROHIBITED from CEO strategic discussions
CTO REQUIRED to report to COO first
CTO assumed had Supabase access
TODO.md managed by Claude Code
```

### After (Aligned with Brandmine)
```
CEO ↔ COO ↔ CTO (collaborative)
CTO can ask CEO business questions anytime
COO reviews quality, doesn't block decisions
CTO writes SQL → CEO executes in Supabase
BACKLOG.md owned by CTO
```

---

## Notes for Brandmine

This alignment was done for Georgetown Rotary project. Brandmine may want to review and potentially adopt:

1. **Database Access Constraint**: If Brandmine has similar access separation (CEO has DB access, CTO doesn't), document this clearly
2. **System Access Constraints Section**: Consider adding to Brandmine's workflow docs
3. **Backlog Command Flexibility**: "Code, backlog this:" OR "CTO, backlog this:" - both work
4. **Quality Checklist Role Clarity**: Explicitly mark which role does what (CTO: writes, CEO: executes, etc.)

The Georgetown changes maintain Brandmine's core 3-role collaborative philosophy while adding clarity around system access constraints that may be project-specific.

**Files Modified:**
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/dev-charter.md`
- `docs/workflows/ceo-coo-cto-workflow.md` (renamed from `docs/reference-data/ceo-cto-workflow.md`)
- `docs/workflows/database-migration-workflow.md`
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` (created)
- `docs/archive/TODO-old-workflow.md` (archived)
- `docs/archive/TODO-migration-note.md` (created)

**Core Principle**: CEO is not a project manager. COO is not a blocker. CTO is not micromanaged.
