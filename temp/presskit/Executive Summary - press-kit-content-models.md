# Executive Summary - Press Kit Content Models

## Critical Findings for Brandmine's Multilingual Platform



## **Strategic Context**

This research delivers production-ready database schemas for a multilingual digital press kit platform optimized for Global South brands seeking international media coverage, investors, and business partners. The models address three fundamental market gaps: (1) zero platforms offer built-in multilingual press kit generation, (2) systematic exclusion of emerging markets through Western pricing/payment models, and (3) lack of export readiness tracking essential for cross-border trade.



## **Key Research-Backed Insights**

### **Journalist Behavior & Press Kit Requirements**
- **79% of journalists rely on press releases** for story ideas (Cision 2025 State of Media)
- **72% cite press releases as most useful PR resource** for content generation
- **Multimedia increases engagement 3-6x**: Photos, videos, and infographics dramatically outperform text-only materials
- **Critical components**: Journalists prioritize (1) clear headline/lead paragraph, (2) direct contact information, (3) high-resolution images in multiple aspect ratios, (4) executive quotes with insights, and (5) factual data with sources

### **Multilingual Architecture Requirements**
- **Text expansion buffers required**: German/French expand 30-35% beyond English; UI elements expand 40-50%
- **Right-to-left language support**: Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu require `direction: rtl` and mirrored UI layouts
- **Database configuration**: UTF-8 (utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci collation) mandatory for global character support
- **Translation workflow**: Hybrid AI + human review delivers cost-effective quality; AI alone insufficient for business-critical content

### **Global South Market Specifics**
- **EAC certification is mandatory** for EAEU markets (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan)—brands cannot legally sell without it
- **Language capabilities matter**: 76% of international buyers prefer content in native languages; English proficiency (B2+ level) required for export readiness
- **Payment methods**: Wire transfer, letter of credit, and regional digital wallets (not just credit cards) essential for cross-border transactions
- **Purchasing power parity pricing**: Tier 3 markets (Central Asia, Africa) require 60-80% discounts from Western baseline to achieve affordability

### **SaaS Business Metrics**
- **CAC target**: $900-1,350 for mid-market B2B SaaS; track by acquisition channel for optimization
- **CAC payback period**: 12-18 months is healthy benchmark
- **Churn warning signs**: Usage decline, payment failures, and NPS scores predict churn 30-60 days early
- **Healthy churn rate**: <5-7% annually for B2B SaaS; 20-30% indicates immediate intervention needed
- **LTV:CAC ratio target**: 3:1 to 5:1 minimum for sustainable growth
- **Net Revenue Retention**: >100% (expansion revenue exceeds churn) signals product-market fit



## **Three Production-Ready Content Models**

### **1. Press Kit Model**
**Purpose**: Core content unit enabling media coverage generation

**Critical Fields**:
- **Multilingual content**: Headline, lead paragraph, body (300-500 words), boilerplate
- **Translation workflow tracking**: AI translation → human review → approval → publication
- **Media assets**: Minimum 3 aspect ratios (1:1, 4:3, 16:9) for Google News compliance
- **Contact information**: Direct email + phone (not forms only)
- **Analytics**: Views, downloads, time on page, media coverage conversion
- **Completeness score**: 0-100 quality metric (target >85 for optimal media pickup)

**Text Expansion Strategy**:
```
headline: VARCHAR(195)           // 150 base + 30% expansion
subheadline: VARCHAR(260)        // 200 base + 30% expansion
meta_description: VARCHAR(195)   // 160 base + 22% expansion
button_text: VARCHAR(21)         // 15 base + 40% expansion (UI elements)
```

**Schema.org Structured Data**: NewsArticle markup with proper image, date, author, and publisher fields for search engine optimization

### **2. Brand Model**
**Purpose**: Company profile enabling investor due diligence and buyer evaluation

**Critical Fields**:

- Export experience: Markets served, years exporting, percentage of revenue from exports

**Financial Profile** (for investor audiences):
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Customer retention rate (target >90%)
- LTV:CAC ratio (target 3:1 to 5:1)
- Net Revenue Retention (target >100%)
- Total funding raised

**Purchasing Power Parity Pricing**:
- Tier 1 (High income: UAE, Saudi Arabia): 100% base price
- Tier 2 (Upper-middle: Russia, Brazil): 60-80% of base
- Tier 3 (Lower-middle: Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan): 40-60% of base

### **3. Founder/People Model**
**Purpose**: Executive profiles building credibility with media and investors

**Critical Fields**:
- **Biographical content**: Short (50-75 words), medium (150-200 words), long (300-500 words) versions in each language
- **Language proficiency**: Array with CEFR levels (A1-C2); B2+ required for international business

- C1-C2: Proficient (C1+ for executive leadership roles)



## **Database Architecture Highlights**

### **Character Set Configuration**
```sql
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci
```
- **utf8mb4**: Full Unicode support (including emoji and rare characters)
- **unicode_520_ci**: Case-insensitive collation supporting all languages
- **Critical**: Prevents data loss for Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, emoji

### **Translation Table Pattern**
```sql
CREATE TABLE press_kit_translations (
  press_kit_id UUID,
  language_code CHAR(5),  -- 'en-US', 'ru-RU', 'ar-SA'
  headline VARCHAR(195),
  body_content MEDIUMTEXT,
  translation_status ENUM('pending', 'ai_translated', 'human_review', 'approved', 'published'),
  translation_method ENUM('human', 'machine', 'hybrid'),
  ai_confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
  human_reviewed BOOLEAN,
  PRIMARY KEY (press_kit_id, language_code)
);
```

### **Translation Workflow States**
1. **pending** → Awaiting translation
2. **ai_translated** → GPT-4/DeepL completed (60-80% accuracy baseline)
3. **human_review** → Native speaker reviewing (required for business-critical content)
4. **approved** → Quality verified, ready for publication
5. **published** → Live to public



## **Conversion Optimization Framework**

### **Press Kit Completeness Algorithm**
Quality score weighted by journalist priority (0-100 scale):
- Headline present: +15 points
- Lead paragraph (5 W's): +10 points
- Body content (300-500 words): +15 points
- Company boilerplate: +10 points
- Media assets (3+ images): +20 points
- Contact information: +15 points
- SEO meta description: +10 points
- Open Graph image: +5 points

**Target**: >85 for optimal media pickup rates

### **Customer Health Scoring (Churn Prevention)**
Churn risk score (0-100, higher = higher risk):
- Days inactive >14: +20 points
- Login frequency decline >50%: +15 points
- NPS score <6: +25 points
- Payment failures >0: +30 points (critical indicator)
- Support tickets with negative sentiment: +10 points

**Action Thresholds**:
- 0-30: Low risk (standard engagement)
- 31-60: Medium risk (proactive check-in)
- 61-80: High risk (immediate intervention)
- 81-100: Critical risk (executive escalation)

### **CAC Tracking by Channel**
```sql
new_customers_by_channel JSON
-- {"paid_search": 45, "organic": 78, "referral": 23, "events": 12}

blended_cac = total_marketing_sales_spend / total_new_customers
channel_cac = channel_spend / channel_customers
```

**Optimization Strategy**: Shift budget toward channels with lowest CAC and highest LTV

- **Twitter Cards**: 1200x675px image, optimized for feed display
- **Hreflang tags**: Signal language/region variants to search engines

### **Image SEO**
- **Google News compliance**: 3 aspect ratios required (1:1, 4:3, 16:9)
- **Minimum resolution**: 1200px width for each ratio
- **Alt text**: 125-150 characters, descriptive (not keyword-stuffed)
- **File naming**: Descriptive (product-launch-hero.jpg, not IMG_1234.jpg)

### **URL Structure**
```
https://press.example.com/en/releases/product-launch/
https://press.example.com/fr/releases/product-launch/
https://press.example.com/ar/releases/product-launch/
