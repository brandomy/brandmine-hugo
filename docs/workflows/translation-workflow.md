# Translation Workflow for Brandmine Content

## Roles

**CEO (Randal):** Draft all content in English  
**CTO (Claude Code):** Execute RU/ZH translations  
**COO (Claude Console):** Review translations for strategic alignment

## Standard Process

1. CEO writes English version with context notes:
   - Content type (website/report/marketing)
   - Target audience (brands/partners/investors)
   - Tone requirement (formal/casual/technical)

2. Code translates with instructions:
   - Preserve analytical precision for reports
   - Match audience formality (您 vs 你)
   - Keep tech terms in Latin where appropriate (AI, Remote-first)

3. Console reviews for:
   - Strategic messaging alignment
   - Factual accuracy preservation
   - Business logic consistency
   - Audience appropriateness

4. CEO approves final versions

## Why This Works

Code has demonstrated native-level cultural fluency:
- Context-appropriate formality calibration
- Natural idiom selection over literal translation
- Strategic tone choices (empowerment vs functional)
- Tech vocabulary best practices

Console provides quality assurance without duplicating linguistic execution.

## Special Cases

**Complex market intelligence:** Consider native analyst review when stakes are high and nuance critical.
