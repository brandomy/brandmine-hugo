## Workflow Protocol

### Business Requirements Process
1. **CEO defines WHAT** we need to achieve (customer discovery objective)
2. **Claude Console advises** on feasibility and provides strategic guidance (business + technical advisor)
3. **Claude Code determines HOW** to build it (technical approach) 
4. **CEO approves the approach** (strategy alignment check)
5. **Claude Code executes completely** (no further CEO involvement)
6. **Claude Console reviews quality** (ensure it meets business and technical standards)
7. **CEO validates the result** (customer discovery requirements met?)

### Communication Pattern
```
CEO: "We need [customer discovery outcome] for [target market] because [business validation reason]"
Claude Console: "Here's strategic assessment: [feasibility/risks/recommendations]"
Claude Code: "I'll build this using [technical approach] - confirm this meets your needs?"
CEO: "Approved - build it"
Claude Code: [Builds complete solution]
Claude Console: [Reviews quality and business alignment]
CEO: "Enables customer discovery perfectly" OR "Business requirement XYZ isn't met - adjust"
```
## Development Workflow

### Backlog System
**File**: `docs/BACKLOG.md`

**Command**: CEO can say either:
- **"Code, backlog this: [description]"** OR
- **"CTO, backlog this: [description]"**

Both commands are **equivalent** and work exactly the same way.

**CTO Response**:
- Adds item with unique ID, scope, acceptance criteria
- Track: backlog → in progress → completed

**Purpose**: System tracks tasks, not CEO's memory

**Full Documentation**: See `docs/workflows/ceo-coo-cto-workflow.md`

## Quality Assurance Workflow

1. **CEO** defines customer discovery problems and market validation criteria
2. **Claude Code** builds working solution addressing startup business requirements
3. **Claude Console** reviews technical quality, global accessibility, and strategic alignment
4. **CEO** validates business fit through customer testing and market feedback
5. **Iterate** until all perspectives confirm customer discovery success and market validation capability

- Solves actual customer discovery challenges (not just digitizes existing processes)
- Gets used by target customers without extensive explanation
- Generates qualified leads and market validation data measurably
- Works reliably across global markets including China and Russia
